# Refence Guide for Claude Code

This document contains the necessary information needed for Claude Code to help with the assignment efficiently.

## Important Files and Folders
1. `assignments/` - This is the folder that contains all the assignment questions. Any time a question is asked, this is the first folder you will visit to try and figure out which assignment i am talking about. Usually I'll refer the specific assignment by filename to you.

## Tech Stack
The programming language used for all kinds of code is Python. The local environment is only going to be used for generating code and verifying minor correctness and other minor issues. The actual model training will happen in Google Colab, so all code written must be in the format of jupyter notebooks.

Testing framework is pytest and for package management, uv is used.

## Coding Guidelines
1. After any new feature is added in a cell, always add pytest tests for that in the next cell. For example:

    ```python
    // New python feature
    ```

    ```python
    // Pytest tests
    ```

2. All diagrams and plots generated using matplotlib must be generated on a dark background, with #121212 as the background color. The rest of the colors on the diagram should be generated such that it complements this color well.

## Minor Notes
1. If you run a command and the output says "Module Not Found", you can run "uv add <module-name>" to install it in the repo and modify the pyproject.toml accordingly. Just make sure to ask me before installing anything.

2. Create a new file, named PROMPTS.md and anytime I write a prompt that is very important in the context of the project, write it there. And explain the context briefly and what you did there. Prompts are graded for my assignment.

3. SPEC.md structure: The SPEC.md file is a pure technical spec. Not a log of throught process. Things like context, thought process, etc should not be part of SPEC.md. It should only contain implementation details.

4. Anytime you make a numeric claim like in SPEC.md you said "~7–12s for the full MIND val/test population (65,173 users) at the matmul step, ~19–40s for top-K selection — under two minutes total, and proportionally faster for EB-NeRD", also write the commands in README.md that would allow to verify these claims in one command.
